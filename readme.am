Code for paper: K. Konstantinidis, S. Papadopoulos and Y. Kompatsiaris, (2013) "Community Structure, Interaction 
and Evolution Analysis of Online Social Networks around Real-World Social Phenomena", PCI 2013, Thessaloniki, 
Greece, to appear.
Due to Twitter's terms and permissions (https://dev.twitter.com/terms/api-terms), the data in the files regarding 
the paper has been transformed from a <authorname mentionedname1,mentionedname2,... "time" text>  form, 
to a <authorID mentioneID1,mentionedID2,... "time">  form,so unfortunately the content of the tweets is not available. 
The data to reproduce the experiments can be retrieved from the 
http://www.socialsensor.eu/results/software/82-twitter-dataset-pci2013 site.

%%%Evolution analysis (Matlab)%%%
Any new data to be analysed should be placed in the ../data/ folder replacing the <1.txt> file.
The matlab code consists of 7 files which can either work as standalone scripts, or as functions of the main.m script. 
The only thing that needs changing is a comment of the function line in each of the m-files (instructions are included 
in the m-files).
These 7 files are:
step1_mentioning_frequency.m
	This .m file extracts the user activity in respect to twitter mentions
step2_dyn_adj_mat_wr.m
	This .m file extracts the dynamic adjacency matrices for each respective timeslot and save it into a mat 
	format for use with the rest of the code but also in a csv gephi-ready format.
step3_comm_detect_louvain.m
	This .m file detects the communities in each adjacency matrix as well as the sizes of the communities and the 
	modularity for each timeslot using Louvain mentod (V. D. Blondel, J.-L. Guillaume, R. Lambiotte, and E. Lefebvre.
	Fast unfolding of communities in large networks. Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment, 
	2008(10):P10008 (12pp), 2008.).
step4_comm_evol_detect.m
	This .m file detects the evolution of the communities between timeslots.
step5_commRoutes.m
	This .m file detects the routes created by the evolution of the communities between timeslots.
step6_commIndivCentrality.m
	This .m file extracts the user centrality of all adjacency matrices in between timeslots using the pagerank 
	algorithm.
step7_commRouteAnal.m
	This .m file provides an analysis of the communities in respect to their evolution in terms of 	persistence, 
	stability and user centrality.
	
There are also 4 assistive functions which are used to extract the position of each user in the adjacency matrix 
(pos_aloc_of_usrs.m), to create the adjacency matrix (adj_mat_creator.m), to perform the community detection 
(comm_detect_louvain.m) and to extract the centrality of each user using the pagerank algorithm (mypagerank.m).
%%%
The final outcome is a cell array in ../signifComms.mat containing the most significant dynamic communities, their users
and the centrality of the users.
.../commEvol.mat and .../commEvolSize are also useful are they present the evolution of the communities and the community
sizes respectfully. A heatmap presenting the evolution and size of all evolving communities is also produced giving the 
user an idea of the bigger picture.
